1. Neural Network from Scratch
Ease of Use
Complexity: Building a neural network from scratch involves writing all the code for training, updating, and managing the model yourself. This can be quite complex and time-consuming.
Learning Curve: Requires a good understanding of neural network mechanics. You’ll need to handle details like weight adjustments and backpropagation manually.
Performance
Slower: Custom implementations might not be as efficient, particularly with large datasets or complex models.
Limited Features: You may not have access to advanced optimizations that can enhance performance.
Flexibility
Full Control: Allows complete customization of your model’s architecture and training process.
Educational Value: Provides a deep understanding of how neural networks operate internally.
2. Using PyTorch or TensorFlow
Ease of Use
User-Friendly: These libraries provide high-level tools and functions to build and train neural networks easily. Most of the heavy lifting is handled by the library.
Quick Setup: You can set up and train your model with fewer lines of code, making the process faster and more straightforward.
Performance
Faster: PyTorch and TensorFlow are optimized for performance, often using GPUs to speed up the training process.
Efficient: These libraries include many built-in optimizations that improve training speed and efficiency.
Flexibility
Ease of Experimentation: Easily try different models, add layers, or adjust settings with minimal code changes.
Tools and Support: Offer robust tools for model visualization, debugging, and deployment, which simplifies development.
